### Creating A Property
To ensure flexibility and maintainability, the property name is passed as a default value through the request body, facilitating future updates or modifications.
### Reading An Attached Exel File And Saving
Please use the property_id to save unit data from an Excel file. You'll find the property_id provided as a query string, which you obtained from the API mentioned earlier. Kindly follow the instructions to attach the Excel file as required. This ensures that the unit data is properly associated with the corresponding property.
### Fetching Unit List Data 
This feature is pretty straightforwardâ€”it simply retrieves all unit data from the server. However, to view the data, make sure you've followed all the steps mentioned earlier. This ensures you have the necessary access and context to interact with the retrieved unit information seamlessly.
